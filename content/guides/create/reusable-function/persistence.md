# What persistence support choose ?

All persistence support can be used by functions. But JPA is for now the recommended persistence type as it doesn't depend on an application instance, allowing load balancing.

# Configuration

Function must allow users to configure the persistence. For instance, if the function uses JPA, it must provide a configurable JPA unit.

> IMPORTANT: An actual issue is that functions must choose if they are configurable via JNDI or not. It can't be defined by users.

On the other hand, users must not have to take care of function tables. They must be generated by Hibernate.

# Backup & Restore

Functions must provide a way to import and restore data independently from the database, ie. function should not provide SQL scripts. This will allow functions to change later the persistence without making user data outdated. This must be done with the [SEED Core data](#!/seed-doc/core/data).

Function can also provide golden data if needed with the same mechanism.

> Persistence is optional. For instance: SEED IO Function does not use persistence.
