We are happy to announce the release of the 2.1.1 i18n-addon. The 2.1.0 was mostly an upgrade to the new addons
architecture. But the 2.1.1 comes with important fixes and some new features.

# Fixes

First we have fix the localization issues which was due to a mismatch between standard locale codes (es-AR) and Java
locale codes (es-AR). It is now possible to use locales without issues. However, this fix comes with a price, all the
locale codes (with language and country, e.g. "fr_FR") in the database have to be converted by replacing "_" by "-".

The CSV import feature has also been fixed. It is now possible to import multiple translation files.

# New features

By default when a translation is missing for a given locale the i18n-addon doesn't return a translation to the frontend.
In this case w20 fallback to the default locale. This can be useful, but it can leads to pages with mixin languages. So
a strict mode is now possible. When the strict mode is enable the i18n-addon will the return the key name between brackets
for the missing translations. You can enable it by add the following configuration:

    org.seedstack.i18n.allow-missing-translation=false

Other new feature it is easier to add locales not supported by your platform:

    org.seedstack.i18n.additional-locales=br-FR,ca-ES
