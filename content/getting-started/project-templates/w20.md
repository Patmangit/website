When you need to create a browser-only Single Page Application, you can use the [Web framework](/docs/w20) independently from
other SeedStack components. This type of application can invoke backend(s) written with any technology through REST
APIs. 

{{% callout tips %}}
This type of application is composed of static files only which are best served by specialized infrastructure, like
an optimized Web server or even a Content Delivery Network (CDN). They can also be served as a part of a backend application.

# Creation

To create a browser-only W20 application, run the following command:

```plain
yo w20
```

This will invoke the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) W20 generator. It requires that you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with the `yo`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`
and `gulp` packages globally installed. You also need to install the `generator-w20` package globally or have Yeoman
do it for you.

# Result

If the process is successful, you should see a structure similar to the following:

```plain
- bower_components       <-- dependencies
      
- fragments              <-- application fragments (one per directory)
    - ...
    
- bower.json
- index.html             <-- application master page
- w20.app.json           <-- application configuration
```
