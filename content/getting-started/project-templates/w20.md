When you need to create a browser-only Single Page Application, you can use the [Web framework]({{< ref "docs/w20/index.md" >}}) independently from
other SeedStack components. This type of application can invoke backend(s) written with any technology through REST
APIs.<!--more-->

{{% callout tips %}}
This type of application is composed of static files only which are best served by specialized infrastructure, like
an optimized Web server or even a Content Delivery Network (CDN). They can also be served as a part of a backend application.

# Creation

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed. 
To create a browser-only W20 application, run the following command:

```plain
npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli gulp generator-w20
 yo w20
```

{{% callout info %}}
This will install the `yo`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`, `gulp` and `generator-w20` NPM packages globally. You may prefer to
install some locally (in the project directory) by removing the `-g` option. The generator is based on [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

# Result

If the process is successful, you should see a structure similar to the following:

```plain
- bower_components       <-- dependencies
      
- fragments              <-- application fragments (one per directory)
    - ...
    
- bower.json
- index.html             <-- application master page
- w20.app.json           <-- application configuration
```
