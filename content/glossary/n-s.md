# SPI

Service Provider Interface (SPI) is an API intended to be implemented or extended by a third party. It can be used to 
enable framework extension and replaceable components. SeedStack provides numerous SPI, allowing the developer to extend
its capabilities and behaviors when needed. In SeedStack, all SPI live in a specific subpackage named `*.spi`.
