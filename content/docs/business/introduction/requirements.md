To help you achieve success with SEED Business Framework, you'll find a list of requirements below.

# Development team

In one sentence, requirements are experience and interest in Object Oriented Programming and Design. That is :

- developers with a good professional or academic experience with OOP concepts.
- a good sense of design patterns usage and a readability to learn them:

	- Identify a pattern,
	- Know when to use it,
	- Know when not to use it.

Some Design Patterns are widely used in SEED Business Framework. Having those in mind is a prerequisite to be able to design 
an application with SEED Business Framework. **ie. Factory, Repository, Observable, etc.**

# Business expertise

The Domain being the area of concern of the software - that is the client's need - the project development team needs a direct and easy communication with business experts. 

<br>
Advantages are: 

- understanding the business and the scope/Domain area covered by the project
- speaking the same language 
- defining a Model (eg. graph, requirements, diagram ...) of the Domain that is (kept) clear for everyone
- helping the developers understand what they are doing (=> motivation , cleaner and readable code, scalable).

# Iterative process  

An iterative process goes with a regular communication between expertise and development team. The idea is to get fast achievements and feedbacks before getting into the detailed implementation not to waste time and be able to adjust "on that little bit". "mocking up" and "brainstorming" are essential in this process at every level of the project management and between those levels (including the development team who manages the code and actual design...). 

<br>
Advantages are:

- staying tuned / remaining in the subject / understanding one another 
- refining the shared Domain language (Glossary?) and Model (step by step = closer to Business)
- continuous integration and feedback from development team and client regarding latest deliveries or requirements.

It's up to the team to use methods like SCRUM to have regular meeting to evaluate how the project is evolving regarding above listed points.
