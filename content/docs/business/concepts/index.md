# Definitions

- **Domain**: A sphere of knowledge, influence or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the 
*domain* of the software. The domain is completely agnostic of the application logic.
- **Model**: An abstraction (eg. class diagram, mind map, plain text) that describes a domain and can be used to solve 
problems related to that domain.
- **Bounded context**: Like a model, it describes a sub-domain or a specific aspect of it (eg. full text search feature 
for documentation management).
- **Ubiquitous language**:  Agreed Vocabulary shared between all part takers of a project within a Bounded context or Model.
- **Domain Driven Design**: Domain Driven Design is an approach to the development of complex software adding on OOP to 
allow designers to concentrate on Business concerns rather than infrastructure ones.

# DDD Spirit

- Domain Driven Design (DDD) is **more about a way of thinking than code** but it does have great impacts on code.
- It does not really introduce any new concept or Design Pattern but **provides a glue, a vocabulary and tangible means 
to manipulate existing concepts** in a comprehensive way.
- **By focusing on the Business first, it makes sense of the rest** (User requirements, Design, Code, shared knowledge) 
and have the rest make more sense.
