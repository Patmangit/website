The masterpage is the only entry point of a W20 application. It is the only full page served when a user access the
application. Its responsibility is to load W20 with a `<script>` tag and to define the application top-level layout. 
A minimal master page can be like the following:

    <!doctype html>
    <html data-w20-app>
    <head>
        <title>Application title</title>
        <script type="text/javascript" data-main=".../w20-core/modules/w20" src=".../w20-core/libext/requirejs/require.js"></script>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div data-ng-view></div>
    </body>
    </html>

# Head

Two things are required to load a W20 application:

* a `<script>` tag to load RequireJS (bundled with `w20-core`) and specify the w20 module as the main module module, 
* a `data-w20-app` attribute on the `html` tag.

Any other tag can be added in the head but be aware that due to the asynchronous nature of W20 initialization the loading 
order between masterpage-loaded and W20-loaded resources is undefined. To be on the safe side, rely on the W20 loader to 
load any of the application dependencies.

# Body

As a W20 application is also an AngularJS application, you must add a `<div>` tag with the `data-ng-view` attribute
on it to display the AngularJS current view contents. If you need any additional tag in the body, feel free to add
them. As this is a single page application, all tags defined in the body are present on all application views.
