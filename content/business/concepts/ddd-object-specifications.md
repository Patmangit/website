There is no specific way to get an insightful model that abstracts and represents your business with words or drawings. 

---

We can provide a few guidelines:

- get to know the vocabulary and meaning of [DDD](#!/business-doc/understanding-ddd#introduction) Model Design
- follow the [requirements](#!/business-doc/requirements) (ie. ubiquitous language, iterative process, etc)
- the model can take the form of a drawing, text...
- the model has to use representations and vocabulary that make sense from the product owner to the development team
- your model evolves as your business (whether by expansion or precision)
- when the model gets too big, a "context map" can define coherent "sub-parts" and interfaces
- "sub-parts" are bounded contexts but not only (eg. a specific functionality implying technical complexity can have its own context)
